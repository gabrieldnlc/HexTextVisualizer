A tool to help analyze text tables in Hex files. Created for the tables used by Konami on the Tag Force series, but can be used to read data laid out in a similar way.

Made with C++ and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for Windows. Unit testing is powered by [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/).

# TO DO

* Display pointers connected to values
* Editing values + updating pointers

# Usage

```Bash
$ HexTextVisualizer <filename> -s <first_byte> -e <last_byte>
```

**If first_byte and last_byte are not specified, the application will try to parse the entire file, which can cause an overflow.**

# Build instructions

HexTableVisualizer uses [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) to handle solution files. 

Run VS2022.bat to get an .sln file targeting Visual Studio 2022 or use the command line to run Premake passing the [desired target](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake/) as a parameter:

```Bash
$ cd premake/
$ premake5.exe --file=../premake5.lua <desired-target>
```
